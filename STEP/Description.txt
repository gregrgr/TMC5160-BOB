Nice stepper driver and controller.
You can connect an ABN encoder to it for closed loop feedback.
(Basically you can connect it via single ended wiring versus differential wiring)
The link below will explain the difference in the answers section:

This encoder uses differential wiring but you can still connect it to the board by connecting the ABZ connections:
